## 📖 Overview

**PALengke** (a play on the Filipino word for "market") is a mobile solution developed during the **IBPAP Hackathon (Can You HackIT?)**.

The application addresses the digitization gap in informal markets by providing vendors with smart tools to manage their business. Built under strict 24-hour hackathon constraints, this project demonstrates rapid cross-platform development and the practical application of Artificial Intelligence in micro-retail environments.

## 💡 Key Features

* **🤖 AI-Powered Chatbot:** An integrated smart assistant that handles customer inquiries automatically, allowing vendors to focus on sales rather than messaging.
* **📊 Predictive Restocking:** Analyzes sales trends to generate "Smart Suggestions" on **when** to restock and **how many** units to order, reducing food waste and stockouts.
* **📱 Cross-Platform UI:** A unified mobile interface built with React Native, designed to be accessible for non-technical users.
* **📦 Real-time Inventory:** Live tracking of goods and produce.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React Native (JavaScript)
* **AI/ML:** Custom logic for sales prediction & NLP for Chatbot
* **Backend Integration:** REST APIs

## 🏆 Hackathon Context

This project was built during the **IBPAP Can You HackIT? Hackathon**. The challenge was to innovate solutions for local industries. Our team focused on **Inventory Management**, successfully integrating AI logic for restock predictions within the limited competition timeframe.
